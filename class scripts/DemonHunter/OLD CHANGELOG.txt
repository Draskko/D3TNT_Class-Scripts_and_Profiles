8/17
- Vault works if there is more than 1 enemy within 20 radius. (instead of 10 like before on stock)
- Smoke Screen and Shadow Power works if you go under 60% HP. (Before Shadow Power did not work at all on stock)
- Preparation fires off every time it needs to be right before you start attacking. (Did not fire off on stock)
- I have gotten the DH to kite FAR more than the stock script does. (Did not kite nearly as much on stock)

9/8

- Now handles runs from any debuff that does dmg to you (AOE)!
